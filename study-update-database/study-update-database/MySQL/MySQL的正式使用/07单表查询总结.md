## 单表查询的综合案例

找出每个岗位（除manager之外）的平均薪资，只要平均薪资大于1500的，要求按照平均薪资降序排

命令： 

```mysql
select job,avg(sal) from emp where job != 'manager' group by job having avg(sal) > 1500 order by avg(sal) desc;
```

或者： 

```mysql
select job,avg(sal) from emp where job not in ('manager') group by job having avg(sal) > 1500 order by avg(sal) desc;
```
